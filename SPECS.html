                QWEN has 16 general purpose 8-bit registers named R0 to RF. RF is the carry flag. QWEN also has a 16-bit registers called RI.
                <br>
                This register is used to store memory addresses. There is also the stack pointer (SP) which is used to store return addresses when

                subroutines are called. It has the 16-bit program counter (PC) too.

                The stack is an array of 64 16-bit values, used to store return address when subroutines are called. The stack pointer (SP) is 16-bit, it

                QWEN Display resolution is 256x240 pixels. Its color is 4-bit.

                <br>
                The pixels are bytepacked. Each pixel will contain 4 bit of data. For example, the bit 0b0000 is a single-pixel with a white color.
                <br>
                QWEN can draw graphics on screen with sprites too. A sprite is a group of byte which represent a picture. QWEN sprites can be up to 128 bytes, for
